# Pick a term topic

This assignment's purpose is to decide on a term topic and describe briefly why you are interested in this topic. You can choose one of the following suggestions or a suitable topic of your own choosing related to the broader field of geomicrobiology (by *suitable* I mean that a topic choice on *what the great rubber ducky incident of 1992 taught us about ocean circulation* may be a very interesting topic but not a suitable one for this class). When I doubt, come talk to me after class or send me an email.

 - The role of microbes in acid mine drainage
 - Microbial mineral processing
 - Bioremediation
 - Microbial controls on mineral deposit signatures
 - Microbes, oil, and gas
 - Microbial Geoengineering
 - Terraforming

All members of a team must have a different term project topic. Please bounce ideas on topics and journal articles for L&Gs off of your teammates. While this assignment is simply about choosing your term topic, it is important to keep in mind the two writing assignments you will complete based on this topic:

1. The first will be a short "Latest & Greatest" (L&G) perspective piece (30% of the term project grade) on a publication related to the chosen topic (either on a recently published study or a classic paper). The L&Gs are an opportunity to practice and hone your critical reading and writing skills in the context of learning more about your topic of interest.Â The L&G assignment is already posted on the [schedule page](https://2017-geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule/#assignments) if you want to take a closer look what it is all about.

2. The second (70% of the term project grade) will be a term paper on your topic based on a review of the primary scientific literature for students taking the 4700 version of this course; and a short proposal based on a research question related to your topic for students taking the 5700 version of this course.

## Assignment

1. Fill out the questions in the `assignment.md` file.
2. Submit to the `submit` branch.

If you are unsure how to work this assignment, please re-watch the video tutorial for the very first assignment. This is an individual assignment so you should complete the writing by yourself but you are encouraged to bounce ideas off your teammates. If you do get stuck with any of the technical aspects surrounding the assignment (access, editing, submission, etc.), see if one of your teammates can help you. If all else fails, please email the instructor for help.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, submit by the usual method, i.e. creating a pull request with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer.

## Grading

This assignment will be graded based on completeness. A suitable topic related to the broad field of geomicrobiology that is different from your team mates' topics is required.
